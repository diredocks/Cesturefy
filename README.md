#### Still your favorite gesture extension, now on Chromium-based browsers

Cesturefy is a Chromium adaptation of the popular [Robbendebiene/Gesturefy](https://github.com/Robbendebiene/Gesturefy) mouse gesture extension originally for Firefox, bringing the same smooth gesture control to Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers.

## Limitations

- Cesturefy does not work on Chrome internal pages like `chrome://extensions` or other restricted pages. This is due to browser security restrictions.
- The page must be partially loaded to perform gestures.
- Gestures cannot be properly performed inside iframe pages, because Chrome does not provide the [mozInnerScreenX/Y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/mozInnerScreenX) API.
- On Linux and macOS, right-click menu gestures require a double click to trigger. Chrome does not support the [browserSettings.contextMenuShowEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserSettings/contextMenuShowEvent) API.
